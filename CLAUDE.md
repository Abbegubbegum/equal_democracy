# Equal Democracy (Jämlik Demokrati) — Project Reference

## Working Principles (read first)

These override the default Claude Code defaults for this project:

1. **Production-ready by default.** Every change must work on the deploy target (Vercel serverless), not just on a dev machine. No filesystem writes to `public/`, no assumptions of persistent in-process state across requests, no reliance on a long-running Node process. If a feature needs a cron/queue/blob store in production, wire it up — don't leave a dev-only shim. See [PRODUCTION_READINESS.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS.md) for the running list of patterns to avoid.

2. **Runtime matters.** Consider what happens after deploy: function cold starts, 60s/300s timeouts, read-only filesystem outside `/tmp`, ephemeral `/tmp`, multiple lambda instances, MongoDB connection pooling, CDN caching of `public/`. A solution that works at 5 users but fails at 500 is not finished.

3. **No legacy.** This codebase has no backwards-compatibility burden. If a name is misleading, rename it. If code is dead or unused, delete it. If a pattern is outdated, rewrite it. Don't add deprecation shims, don't preserve old export names, don't keep "removed for X" comments.

4. **Fix what you find.** If you encounter broken, stale, or low-quality code while working on a different task, fix it in the same change. Don't tip-toe around it or file a follow-up note. The exception is large refactors that would obscure the primary diff — flag those before starting.

5. **Keep this file accurate.** When you add a model, route, page, package, or architectural decision, update the relevant section before completing the task. When you delete something, remove its entry. Stale docs are worse than no docs.

6. **Always Read before Edit.** Before any batch of Edits, Read every target file in the same parallel batch — even just `limit: 1` is enough to satisfy the tool. Don't rely on having read the file earlier in the session, and never assume a renamed/moved path is cached. Firing Edit on an unread path errors out and forces a re-read round-trip, which wastes a turn.

## Maintenance

**Before deploying to Vercel**, read [PRODUCTION_READINESS.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS.md) — it tracks patterns in the codebase that work locally but break on serverless (filesystem writes to `public/`, missing cron, etc.) and lists the env vars + checklist for first deploy.

## Project Overview

A democratic participation platform for Swedish municipalities. Citizens can vote in sessions, participate in budget allocation, submit citizen proposals (medborgarförslag), and engage with municipal council meetings. Built as a Turborepo monorepo.

**Live stack:** Next.js 15 · MongoDB/Mongoose · NextAuth (email OTP) · Pusher (real-time) · Resend (email) · Twilio (SMS) · Anthropic Claude API (PDF extraction) · Tailwind CSS v4 · D3.js · Expo React Native

### Key Patterns

**Auth:** Uses JWT tokens (not NextAuth cookies). Tokens stored via `lib/storage.ts` (SecureStore on native, localStorage on web). `useAuth()` exposes `user`, `isLoading`, `requestCode(email)`, `login(email, code)`, `logout()`.

**API calls:** Use `apiClient<T>(path, options)` from `lib/api.ts`. It reads the access token from storage, attaches `Authorization: Bearer`, and silently refreshes on 401 before retrying once.

**Storage:** Always use `lib/storage.ts` (`getItem`/`setItem`/`deleteItem`) instead of `expo-secure-store` directly — it handles the web fallback to localStorage automatically.

**Navigation:** `(app)/_layout.tsx` composes `@react-navigation/material-top-tabs` via `withLayoutContext` from expo-router, configured with `tabBarPosition="bottom"` and a custom `<BottomBar />` (`tabBar` prop) that renders five visible tabs (Hem, Sessioner, Rösta, Förslag, Info) with the existing icon/label/active-tint design. The `archive` screen still exists in the navigator (so deep links and notification routing work) but is filtered out of the `BottomBar` render via `state.routes.filter((r) => r.name !== "archive")`. The underlying `react-native-pager-view` gives native, content-tracking horizontal swipe between tabs — drag with finger and the screen content slides under you, snap is velocity-aware. Tabs do NOT wrap around (stops at Hem and Info, matching standard mobile app behavior). Don't switch back to expo-router's `<Tabs>` — under SDK 54 + Expo Go new architecture, that variant's bottom-tab bar fails to render at all on Android emulators.

**Why custom `<BottomBar />` instead of the default top-tabs bar:** The default material-top-tabs bar is a horizontal scrollable strip with an animated indicator under the active label — wrong shape for a bottom nav. The custom component renders state-driven `<TouchableOpacity>` tabs reading `state.routes` / `state.index` / `descriptors[].options.title` from props, plus an icon mapping in `TAB_ICONS`. Tap handler emits a `tabPress` event (so pager-view can react), then calls `navigation.navigate(route.name)` only if not focused. To hide a tab from the bar without removing the screen, filter it by `route.name` in the `BottomBar` render — do NOT use `tabBarButton: () => null` (that's a bottom-tabs option that doesn't exist on `MaterialTopTabNavigationOptions` and will cause a type error).

**Navigation guards:** `(auth)/_layout.tsx` redirects logged-in users to the app. `(app)/_layout.tsx` redirects unauthenticated users to login. Both check `useAuth()`.

**Sessioner screen (sessions.tsx) — vertical pager:** Uses `react-native-pager-view` with `orientation="vertical"`. Each session is its own page; the page owns its own background `<Image>` (`StyleSheet.absoluteFill`) so there's no shared double-buffer crossfade and no scroll-driven sync to go out of alignment. Inside each page, a `ScrollView` with `nestedScrollEnabled` holds the compact title block + inline proposals list — the user can fine-scroll comments/proposals freely, and pager-view takes over the gesture only when the inner ScrollView is at its top/bottom edge, snapping to the previous/next session. Velocity is handled by pager-view's native gesture recognizer (a flick at the edge commits to next; a slow nudge stays put). The hero block is compact (`paddingTop: insets.top + 64` to clear the XAI button) and the proposals overlay starts immediately below the title. A subtle chevron-down icon (`scrollAffordance`) fades in at the bottom of the page when `contentHeight > viewportHeight` and disappears once the user starts scrolling. `Image.prefetch()` still warms the cache for all session images on load.

**Sessioner infinite loop (PagerView variant):** Triple-array `[...sessions, ...sessions, ...sessions]` with `initialPage = sessions.length` (first item of middle copy). On `onPageSelected`, if `position < n` or `position >= n * 2` (outer thirds), silently `pagerRef.current?.setPageWithoutAnimation()` to the matching slot in the middle copy. An `isJumpingRef` guards against the silent jump re-triggering `onPageSelected`. This is the pager-view adaptation of the older ScrollView-based triple-array pattern still used in `vote.tsx` and `proposals.tsx`.

**Rösta screen (vote.tsx):** TikTok-style full-screen vertical carousel of voting sessions with infinite loop (triple-array pattern, same as `sessions.tsx` and `proposals.tsx`). Each page owns its background image (plain `<Image>` as `absoluteFill` inside the page View — NOT a shared double-buffer). Sessions without an image show a solid dark blue (`#002d75`) base. Uses `containerH` from `onLayout` (not `Dimensions`) so `pagingEnabled` snaps correctly after the tab bar. Active session ("Dagens fråga") shows a compact semi-transparent card; results are hidden before voting to prevent bandwagon effect and appear immediately after voting. Past sessions always show read-only results. Three radio alternatives (Ja/Nej/Avstår). Share button uses React Native `Share.share()`. Yellow "Föreslå en fråga" button pinned to bottom opens a bottom-sheet modal that POSTs to `/api/mobile/suggest-question`. Fetches from `/api/mobile/sessions/voting` (active first, then closed/archived newest-first).

**XAI assistant (XAIModal.tsx):** A dark-blue circle with a sparkles icon floats at the top-left corner of every tab except Hem (rendered in `(app)/_layout.tsx` as an absolute overlay, z-index 100). Tapping it opens a bottom-sheet chat with the Claude API via `/api/mobile/xai`. Shows context-aware quick-action chips based on the current tab (different prompts for Hem, Sessioner, Rösta, Förslag, Arkiv) plus two common actions (write a comment, submit a proposal). Has a "Anmäl XAI" flag button (top-right of the sheet) that users can tap to report bad AI output. Uses `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` with a 300-token limit for quick, concise replies. The floating button hides itself while the modal is open to avoid double-tap confusion.

**XAI modal layout (load-bearing details):** The sheet uses `height: "82%"` (NOT `maxHeight`) and its KeyboardAvoidingView parent uses `flex: 1` — both are required so the inner messages `<ScrollView style={{ flex: 1 }}>` actually gets a non-zero height. With `maxHeight` alone the ScrollView collapses to 0 and the chat appears blank even though `messages` state is correct. The backdrop uses a `<Pressable style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}>` underneath the sheet plus `pointerEvents="box-none"` on the KAV — replaces the previous nested `<TouchableWithoutFeedback>` pattern, which on Android new-architecture swallowed touches before they reached the send button. Reply text is run through a small `parseInline()` tokenizer + `<MarkdownText />` component that renders `**bold**`, `*italic*`, and `` `code` `` inline; user messages render as plain `<Text>`. The server route at `apps/web/pages/api/mobile/xai.ts` logs `XAI request` / `XAI reply` / `XAI call failed` with timings and a `hasKey` flag (true if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set) for quick diagnosis.

**Membership screen (membership.tsx):** Reachable via the **Info** bottom tab and from the Hem tab's "Klicka här" button. Header is a single centered "Bli medlem" title — no back arrow, since this is a tab destination, not a pushed route. Shows member fee (250 kr/år covering both 2026 and 2027 — founding-member benefit) with a highlighted founding-member banner explaining the two-year deal. Lists four member benefits. Swish pay button is disabled. Pending: BankID verification (must confirm user is folkbokförd in Vallentuna, postal code 186xx via Signicat) + actual payment integration. BankID will be optional/voluntary — soft prompt earning bonus stars, hard-required one month before election.

**Content moderation (web):** `POST /api/moderate` checks comment text via Claude Haiku before posting in `apps/web/pages/session/[id].tsx`. Returns `{ status: "ok"|"warn"|"flag", message }`. If warn/flag, shows an inline confirmation dialog with the AI's message; "flag" also shows legal notice. Fails open on error so Claude outages never block posting.

**Star/gamification system (mobile):** Local-only star counter stored via `lib/stars.ts` (SecureStore key `"user_stars"`). Awards: first app open +1, set interests +2, rate a session proposal +3, vote on Rösta question +1, submit citizen proposal +5. One-time actions guarded by storage flags (`celebrated_first_visit`, `celebrated_interests_set`). Star count shown as a badge in the Hem hero (top-left). `lib/CelebrationModal.tsx` is a reusable spring-animated overlay used by all four trigger screens.

**Settings modal (mobile):** `lib/SettingsModal.tsx` is a self-contained bottom-sheet that reads and writes interest preferences to SecureStore internally. Props: `visible`, `onClose`, `onSaved?`. The gear icon appears in the top-right of the blue hero on the **Hem** tab (`index.tsx`) and as a floating button on the **Info** tab (rendered in `(app)/_layout.tsx` when `normPath === "/membership"`). Exports `STORAGE_INTERESTS`, `STORAGE_INTERESTS_ONLY`, and `INTEREST_AREAS` for use elsewhere (e.g. filtering feeds by interests).

**Admin button (mobile):** Inside `SettingsModal`, an "Admin" button is shown only when `user.isAdmin`. Opens `BASE_URL/admin` (super admin) or `BASE_URL/manage-sessions` (regular admin) in the device browser via `Linking.openURL`.

**Infinite vertical loop (Rösta, Förslag):** Both screens use a `ScrollView` with the triple-array pattern: `loopedItems = [...items, ...items, ...items]`, start scrolled to the middle copy (`items.length * pageH`), and silently jump back to the middle copy when `onMomentumScrollEnd` detects the user has reached the outer thirds. Uses `containerH` from `onLayout` (never `Dimensions.get("window").height`) for the page size so `pagingEnabled` snaps correctly. Key refs: `scrollRef`, `currentIdxRef`, `initialScrollDone`. Never use `SCREEN_H` for page heights in these screens. The Sessioner screen has migrated off this pattern to `PagerView` (see its dedicated entry above) — don't propagate the new pager-based pattern to Rösta/Förslag without explicit reason, since each tab's content layout differs.

**"Förslag:" label:** In `proposals.tsx`, a small uppercase label "FÖRSLAG:" appears above each proposal title so the card context is clear at a glance.

**Citizen proposals image upload:** `proposals.tsx` picks images via `expo-image-picker`, compresses to max 1200 px / 75% JPEG quality via `expo-image-manipulator`, then uploads with raw `fetch` + `FormData` (NOT `apiClient`) so React Native can set the correct `multipart/form-data; boundary=…` header automatically. `apiClient` would override Content-Type with `application/json` and break the upload.

**Monorepo + Metro:** `metro.config.js` is required — without it, pnpm's symlinked `node_modules` causes Metro module resolution failures. Always keep it in sync if the monorepo structure changes.

**CORS (web emulator only):** `apps/web/middleware.ts` adds CORS headers for `localhost:8081` and `localhost:19006`. Native builds are unaffected. Add production origins via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated) in `apps/web/.env.local`.

**Environment:** Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `apps/mobile/.env`. Use `http://10.0.2.2:3000` for Android emulator, your LAN IP for physical devices. `localhost` does NOT work on physical devices.

**Push notifications:** Server-side: `apps/web/lib/push-notifications.ts` sends to the Expo Push API, `POST /api/mobile/push-token` stores tokens, `User.expoPushToken` field exists, and `POST /api/admin/sessions` fires a push when a voting session is created. Mobile side: `expo-notifications` is installed and the registration code lives in `(app)/_layout.tsx`, gated by `const IS_EXPO_GO = Constants.executionEnvironment === "storeClient"` — both the notification-tap listener and `getExpoPushTokenAsync()` are wrapped in `if (!IS_EXPO_GO)` blocks so Expo Go silently skips them (remote pushes were removed from Expo Go in SDK 53). In real EAS builds the guards flip off and pushes register automatically. `vote.tsx` calls `setBadgeCountAsync(0)` on focus to clear the badge (a local-only API that works in both Expo Go and EAS builds). The FCM V1 service-account JSON for Android is uploaded to EAS project Credentials (Android → FCM V1), so push **delivery** to Android works; the APNs `.p8` for iOS is still pending. `google-services.json` lives at `apps/mobile/google-services.json` and is referenced via `android.googleServicesFile` in `app.json`; its embedded `AIzaSy…` value is the Firebase Android **client** API key (ships inside the APK, safe to commit — GitHub secret-scanning flags the pattern but it's low-severity; restrict it in GCP Console → APIs & Services → Credentials by package `se.vallentunaframat.app` + SHA-1). The real secret is the separate `…firebase-adminsdk….json` service-account key used for FCM V1 — never commit it; it lives only in EAS.

**EAS production builds:** Package name `se.vallentunaframat.app`, owner `vallentuna-framat`. Production AAB (versionCode 4) is uploaded to Google Play Console under internal testing. iOS TestFlight build is pending (requires Apple Developer account). Build command: `npx eas-cli build --profile production --platform android` from `apps/mobile`.

**EAS dev-client builds (push + native testing):** Push notifications and any other native-module feature can't be exercised in Expo Go — build a custom dev client via EAS. `eas.json` has a `development` profile (`developmentClient: true`, `distribution: internal`, APK) and `expo-dev-client` is a dependency. Build from `apps/mobile`: `npx eas-cli build --profile development --platform android`; install with `npx eas-cli build:run --platform android --latest`; then run Metro with `npx expo start --dev-client`. **Local Android native builds (`expo run:android` / `gradlew`) are NOT viable on this machine** — the repo's long OneDrive path + pnpm's deep `.pnpm/<hash>` nesting + New-Arch Fabric codegen (CMake mirrors the absolute source path into each object path) push generated paths past Windows' 260-char `MAX_PATH`, and the JBR JVM / NDK ninja don't honor long paths. Always use EAS for native builds. Caveat: `android/` is gitignored but EAS **still bundles the local `apps/mobile/android/` folder** and prebuilds non-destructively, so stray edits in the generated `android/` (e.g. a `buildDir` relocation) leak into the cloud build and cause baffling Kotlin `Unresolved reference` failures — delete `apps/mobile/android` before an EAS build so prebuild regenerates it pristine.

**OneDrive + pnpm symlinks:** Installing new packages under `apps/mobile/` can fail with `EPERM rename` because OneDrive locks files during sync. Pause OneDrive sync before running `pnpm add`. If a package still fails to resolve after install, run `pnpm install` from the repo root to repair the lockfile. Avoid packages requiring heavy native linking — `expo-image-picker`, `expo-image-manipulator`, and `react-native-pager-view` are fine (bundled in Expo Go).

**Metro cache after adding native modules:** When you add a native module (e.g. `react-native-pager-view`), Metro's transformer cache and module map don't always pick it up on a normal reload — you'll see `unable to resolve module …` even though the symlink exists in `apps/mobile/node_modules`. Restart with `pnpm expo start -c` (the `-c` clears the cache). Same fix applies whenever Metro's file watcher misses changes inside route groups like `(app)` on Windows + OneDrive.

**Package version drift (SDK 54):** If you see `expo-notifications@55.x` or any other wildly-wrong version in `apps/mobile/package.json`, run `pnpm expo install --check` from `apps/mobile` and accept all suggested fixes. SDK 54 expects `expo-notifications@~0.32.x`, `expo-image-picker@~17.x`, `expo-image-manipulator@~14.x`, etc. A mismatched `expo-notifications` will crash `(app)/_layout.tsx` at module-import time (the file calls `Notifications.setNotificationHandler` at the top), which manifests as the entire tab layout silently failing to render — the symptom looks like "tab bar disappeared" but is actually a JS exception you may not see in Metro unless you look closely.

**Testing with Expo Go:** Scan the QR code shown in the Metro terminal after running `pnpm dev:mobile`. Shake the device to get the reload menu. Press `r` in the Metro terminal to force reload. Expo Go is fine for JS/UI iteration, but push notifications and other native-module features require the EAS dev client (see **EAS dev-client builds** above).

**Municipality whitelist:** `pages/[municipality]/index.tsx`, `pages/[municipality]/[board]/index.tsx`, and `pages/[municipality]/[board]/archive.tsx` all export a `getServerSideProps` that returns `{ notFound: true }` for any municipality not in `VALID_MUNICIPALITIES = ["vallentuna"]`. This prevents the dynamic catch-all from matching arbitrary slugs like `/legal` or `/api`. When adding a new municipality, add its lowercase slug to this constant in all three files.

### Session Phases

Sessions go through: `phase1` (proposal submission + thumbs up) → `phase2` (final yes/no votes) → `closed` → `archived`

Session types: `"standard"` · `"survey"` · `"municipal"` · `"voting"`

**`"voting"` type:** Single yes/no/abstain question for the mobile Rösta tab. Created via manage-sessions "Voting (Yes/No/Abstain)" option. Starts directly in `phase2`. The `place` field stores the question text (max 200 chars). Votes stored in `QuickVote` (not `FinalVote`). Excluded from all ordinary session queries (`getActiveSession`, `/api/sessions/active`, all mobile tabs except Rösta) — only surfaces via `/api/mobile/sessions/voting`.

Access tokens: 7-day expiry · Refresh tokens: 30-day expiry · Signed with `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

Mobile API calls pass `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. Use `verifyBearerToken()` from `lib/mobile-jwt.ts` to protect mobile-specific routes.

## Environment Variables

Required in `apps/web/.env.local`:

```env
# Auth
# NEXTAUTH_URL is per-environment and must match the URL the browser hits — it's
# the base for NextAuth callbacks AND for the links built into OTP/notification
# emails (lib/email.ts getBaseUrl, fallback https://www.vallentuna.app). Local
# dev: http://localhost:3000 (here in .env.local). Vercel Production scope:
# https://www.vallentuna.app (www is canonical — apex 308-redirects). Don't set
# one unscoped value for all Vercel environments. Mobile auth doesn't use it
# (JWT signed with NEXTAUTH_SECRET).
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<random>

# Database (MongoDB Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=                    # Development DB
MONGODB_URI_PRODUCTION=         # Production DB
MONGODB_URI_BACKUP=             # Backup DB

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=

# AI (Claude API)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# Real-time (Pusher)
PUSHER_APP_ID=
PUSHER_KEY=
PUSHER_SECRET=
PUSHER_CLUSTER=eu
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=eu

# SMS (Twilio — optional)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_FROM_PHONE=

# Blob storage (Vercel Blob — required in production; for local dev only if you want uploads to work)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=

# Google Play review bypass (optional — set only while an app review is pending)
# A single whitelisted email logs in with a fixed code instead of a real OTP,
# so Google Play reviewers can get past the email/OTP login wall. Honored by
# /api/auth/request-code (skips the email) and /api/mobile/auth/verify-code
# (accepts the fixed code). The test account is an ordinary member, no admin
# rights. Unset either var to disable instantly.

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Authentication Flow

Email → OTP code (bcrypt-hashed, 10min TTL) → NextAuth session → httpOnly cookie

### CSRF Protection

Dual-cookie pattern: readable cookie + httpOnly cookie. Hash-validated on all POST/PUT/DELETE. Frontend uses `fetchWithCsrf()` from `lib/fetch-with-csrf.ts`. Header: `x-csrf-token`.

### Database Connection

`connectDB()` in `lib/mongodb.ts` uses module-level caching to reuse connections across hot reloads and serverless invocations.

### Mongoose Model Cache (dev HMR gotcha)

`safeModel(name, schema)` returns the already-registered model if one exists — it never replaces it. This means schema changes are silently ignored during hot-module reloading, and Mongoose's strict mode will drop any new fields from documents. Models whose schemas change frequently must use the force-refresh pattern instead:

```ts
if (mongoose.models["ModelName"]) delete mongoose.models["ModelName"];
export const ModelName: AnyModel = mongoose.model("ModelName", ModelNameSchema);
```

`Settings`, `Session`, and `CitizenProposal` already use this pattern. Apply it to any model when adding or removing fields.

### Budget Median Algorithm

Collects all user allocations per category → computes median → balances total to match target budget. Nested support for subcategories.

### AI PDF Extraction

Claude API receives base64-encoded PDF. Budget extraction (`lib/budget/ai-extractor.ts`) produces categories + income sources + tax rates. Agenda extraction (`lib/municipal/agenda-extractor.ts`) produces meeting items.

### Real-time

- **Pusher:** All real-time fan-out (votes, phase transitions, ratings, new proposals, presence). Server publishes via `lib/pusher-broadcaster.ts`; clients subscribe via the `usePusher` hook. Presence channel `presence-active-users` powers the live "active users" count (authed through `POST /api/pusher/auth`).
- **Admin live panel:** uses `GET /api/admin/live-panel` polling for proposal/vote progress metrics (Pusher pushes the events that trigger refetches).

### Internationalization

5 languages: `sv` (default), `en`, `sr`, `es`, `de`. Translation files in `lib/locales/`. `useTranslation()` hook reads from `ConfigContext`.

### Theming

4 color schemes: `default` (blue/yellow), `green`, `red`, `blue`. CSS variables set dynamically. Managed via `ConfigContext`.

## Configuration Files

- **`turbo.json`** — Task pipeline: build depends on `^build`, dev is persistent + no cache; build task declares all Vercel env vars in `env[]` so they're available during CI builds
- **`next.config.mjs`** — standalone output, transpiles all 36 D3 subpackages (ESM), optimizes lucide-react
- **`apps/web/tsconfig.json`** — target ES2018, lib es2018, path alias `@/*` → `./*`, strict OFF. Lib intentionally matches target so `tsc --noEmit` catches syntax newer than the target before build.
- **`postcss.config.mjs`** — Tailwind CSS v4 processing
- **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`** — `apps/*` + `packages/*`
- **`package.json`** (root) — `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist for `sharp` and `unrs-resolver` (suppresses build-script warnings)
- **`apps/mobile/.eslintrc.js`** — extends `expo`; required so `eslint .` works without `expo lint` auto-installing packages
